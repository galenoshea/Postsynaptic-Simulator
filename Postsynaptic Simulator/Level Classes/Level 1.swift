    /*  -When Making a new level class make sure to inherit from Level as seen on line 9.
        -Copy both overrides as they will overwrite the dendrite paths and the level instructions
        -All you need to do is create a new dendrite and make sure you add it to the dendrite array as seen on line 20
        -if you want to specify new ways to win you can override the update function that is found in the Level class. An example of this is found in Level 8 code
